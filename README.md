We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require gustavocaiano/lakeclient
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lakeclient-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lakeclient-config"
```

Base URL can include a port (e.g., http://localhost:8080):

```env
LAKE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

License key from env is optional. The Filament page accepts input and will be used if provided there:

```env
LAKE_LICENSE_KEY=""
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
];
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lakeclient-views"
```

## Usage

### Configure

Set the server base URL (with port if needed):

```env
LAKE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Optional: choose storage driver (file is default, or database):

```env
LAKE_STORAGE_DRIVER=database
```

Then publish and run the migration if using database storage:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="lakeclient-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

### Filament Panel

- Add the plugin to your Filament panel provider:

```php
->plugins([
    \GustavoCaiano\Lakeclient\Filament\Plugins\LakeClientPlugin::make(),
])
```

- Protect routes with the middleware (optional if applied at panel level):

```php
\GustavoCaiano\Lakeclient\Http\Middleware\EnsureLicensed::class
```

- Open the License page and input the license key. The env `LAKE_LICENSE_KEY` is optional and used only as a fallback if the form is empty.

### CLI

```bash
php artisan lake:activate {key?}
php artisan lake:heartbeat
php artisan lake:deactivate
```

### Scheduler (recommended)

Schedule heartbeats frequently; the server TTL dictates when renewals occur. The command will renew only when near expiry (server-driven) and supports jitter to avoid thundering herd.

Examples:

```php
// For short TTLs (e.g., 1â€“2 minutes), schedule every minute
$schedule->command('lake:heartbeat')->everyMinute();

// For moderate TTLs, schedule every 5 minutes
$schedule->command('lake:heartbeat')->everyFiveMinutes();
```

Optional jitter (bounded so it never delays beyond expiry):

```env
LAKE_HEARTBEAT_JITTER_SECONDS=30
```
LAKE_HEARTBEAT_RENEW_THRESHOLD_SECONDS=15

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
